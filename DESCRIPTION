Description: High performance principal component analysis routines
       that operate directly on 'bigmemory::big.matrix' objects. The
       package avoids materialising large matrices in memory by
       streaming data through 'BLAS' and 'LAPACK' kernels and provides
       helpers to derive scores, loadings, correlations, and
       contribution diagnostics, including utilities that stream
       results into 'bigmemory'-backed matrices for file-based
       workflows.
